Isolate Selected in Editor

Isolationist is a small Unity Editor utility that allows you to toggle selected assets into an Isolate mode similar to `Tools > Isolate Select` in Maya where all other objects are hidden while you are editing the selected objects. This makes the objects you've isolated easiser to work with and keeps you from accidentally selecting/editing objects you aren't working on.

To Enter Isolate Mode:
- Select the object or objects you want to isolate
- Use the keyboard shortcut `I`
- Or use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`

To Exit Isolate Mode:
- Select a hidden object in the heirarchy
- Or use the keyboard shortcut `I`
- Or use `Tools Menu > Isolate Selected`

To Modify the Keyboard Shortcut:
- Open `Edit > Preferences... > Isolationist` 
- Select the desired base key and modifiers

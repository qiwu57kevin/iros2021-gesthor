// Maintains rotation based on the myObject object, which is the door of the sim object. This ensures that for any given
// cabinet shape, the cabinet can remain "visible" even when the door is out of frame. 

// to use: Put this prefab in the "TriggerColliders" section of the cabinet 
// rotate the CabinetDoor main sim object to an open position, and then rotate this object to that same position but opposite sign (ie:90, -90)

// Move the four fCol objects so that the camera of the agent can raycast to them when the door is open and out of frame. These fCol objects should
// frame the interior of the cabinet and since they are indivdual and isolated can be moved around to suite any shape or form interior space

        myObject = gameObject.GetComponentInParent<SimObjPhysics>().transform;

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update() {

        // so we need to constantly update the rotation of this object so that the colliders stay in the right place.
        // unforunately we couldnt' just unparent them from the door because the door has the rigidbody, and if they were unparented then the 
        // compound box collider would not propogate up to the rigidbody for visibility detection, so here we are this seems to work!
